# StyLua

An opinionated code formatter for Lua 5.1 and [Luau](https://roblox.github.io/luau/), built using [full-moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon).
StyLua is inspired by the likes of [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), it parses your Lua codebase, and prints it back out from scratch,
enforcing a consistent code style.

## Installation
There are multiple ways to install StyLua:

### With Github Releases
Pre-built binaries are available on the [GitHub Releases Page](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua/releases).
Please note, currently by default, StyLua is built with Luau features enabled. If you would just like to format Lua 5.1 code, please see installing from crates.io

### With [Foreman](https://github.com/Roblox/foreman)
StyLua can be installed using foreman. Add the following to your `foreman.toml` file:
```
stylua = { source = "JohnnyMorganz/stylua", version = "0.4.1" }
```

### Using the VSCode Extension

You can use the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua), which will automatically download StyLua for you.
Set StyLua as your formatter when prompted, or add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file:

```json
"[lua]": {
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "JohnnyMorganz.stylua"
},
```

and StyLua will then be used to format your code. It is recommended to also enable `editor.formatOnSave`.

### From Crates.io
If you have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed, you can install StyLua using cargo
```
cargo install stylua
```
This will compile StyLua (for Lua 5.1) and install it on your local machine.
If you would like Luau features, pass the `--features luau` argument.
```
cargo install stylua --features luau
```

## Usage
Once installed, using StyLua is quick and simple, just pass the files to format to the CLI.
```
stylua src/ foo.lua bar.lua
```
This command will format the `foo.lua` and `bar.lua` file, and search down the `src` directory to format any files within it.

StyLua can also read from stdin, by using `-` as the file name.

### Glob Filtering
When searching through a directory, a glob pattern can be used to specify which specific types of files to format:
```
stylua --glob **/*.lua -- src
```
Multiple glob patterns can be used to match specific files, and not others. For example:
```
stylua -g *.lua -g !*.spec.lua -- .
```
will format all Lua files, but ignore any `.spec.lua` test files.
Note, if you are using the glob argument, it can take in multiple strings, so a `--` is required to break between the glob pattern and the files to format.
The glob defaults to `**/*.lua`.

### Filtering using `.styluaignore`
You can also create a `.styluaignore` file, with a similar format to a `.gitignore` file. Any files matched will be ignored by StyLua.
For example, for a `.styluaignore` file with the following contents:
```
vendor/
```
running `stylua .` will ignore the `vendor/` directory.

### Checking files for formatting
If you want to check that files have been formatted, but not overwrite them, you can pass the `--check` argument to StyLua.
StyLua will search through files as normal, but instead of writing the formatted code back to the file, StyLua will output a diff to stdout.
If there are files which haven't been fully formatted, StyLua will exit with status code 1.

### Formatting Ranges
If you only want to format a specific range within a file, you can pass the `--range-start <num>` and/or `--range-end <num>` arguments,
and only statements within the provided range will be formatted, with the rest ignored. Both arguments are optional, and are inclusive.
If an argument is not provided, the start or end of the file will be used instead respectively.

Currently, only whole statements lying withing the range are formatted. If part of the statement is outside of the range, the statement will be ignored.

There is also support for the formatting selected ranges in the [VSCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JohnnyMorganz.stylua).

## Configuration

StyLua is **opinionated**, so there are as little configuration options as possible.
The CLI will search for a `stylua.toml` file in the current working directory to read the configuration.
Alternatively, you can pass your own path using the `--config-path` argument.

StyLua only offers the following options:

### `column_width`

The approximate line length for printing. This is used as a guide to determine when to wrap lines, but note this is
not a hard upper bound.
Defaults to `120`.

```
column_width = 120
```

### `line_endings`

The type of line endings to use, supports either `Unix` (LF) or `Windows` (CRLF) options.
Defaults to `Unix`.

```
line_endings = "Unix"
```

### `indent_type`

The type of indents to use, supports either `Tabs` or `Spaces`.
Defaults to `Tabs`.

```
indent_type = "Tabs"
```

### `indent_width`

The width of spaces a single indent level should be. This option is ignored if the `indent_type` is set to `Tabs`.
Defaults to `4`.

```
indent_width = 2
```
