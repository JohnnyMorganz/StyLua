# StyLua VSCode Extension

StyLua is an opinionated code formatter for Lua 5.1 and [Luau](https://roblox.github.io/luau/), built using [full-moon](https://github.com/Kampfkarren/full-moon).
StyLua is inspired by the likes of [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier), it parses your Lua codebase, and prints it back out from scratch,
enforcing a consistent code style.

## Information

For more information, see the main [repository](https://github.com/JohnnyMorganz/StyLua)

## Extension Settings

You can specify the path of the StyLua binary using the `stylua.styluaPath` setting.
By default, if this is `null`, the extension will download the binary and store it in its local storage.
